## ⭐️ Introduction

India has been ranked 5th in the list of countries with the highest Non - Performing Assets. It implies India possesses more defaulters each year regarding the subject’s ability to repay their loans. Noticeably this is an alarming figure and with the rise of Bank frauds, figured at high as 100 Crore per day. With this as our motivation, we’ve decided to work on a problem that suitably allows us to identify whether or not a bank can engage in business with a client based on their previous history. Using ML techniques taught, our project aims at creating an efficient model where we can appropriately find the right set of metrics from a diverse group of features that helps us in identifying whether a subject can repay their loan once taken.

## 👨‍💻 Dataset Description

The Dataset has been taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gauravduttakiit/risk-analytics-in-banking-financial-services-1/data). The Dimensionality of the data is **307511 x 122** (rows x columns). It consists of 122 features which give the current status of the applicant in need of a loan or not. This data appropriately has all the important components of the “Current Status” of the subjects. Target Class consists of 0 and 1 whether the subject had payment difficulties. And 0 when the payment was paid on time.
